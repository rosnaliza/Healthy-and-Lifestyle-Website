        <p><strong class="highlight-text">1. Anchor Point:</strong> Start by figuring out what time you need to wake up in the morning. This is your anchor point.</p>

        <p><strong class="highlight-text">2. Sleep Cycles:</strong> A sleep cycle typically lasts around 90 minutes. Aim for 5 to 6 complete sleep cycles. Multiply the number of cycles by 90 to get the total sleep time.</p>

        <p><strong class="highlight-text">3. Sleep Onset:</strong> Add an extra 15-20 minutes for the time it takes to fall asleep. This accounts for the average time it takes for a person to transition from wakefulness to sleep.</p>

        <p><strong class="highlight-text">4. Wind Down Time:</strong> Deduct around 15-30 minutes for a relaxing pre-sleep routine. This can include activities like reading, meditating, or gentle stretching to signal to your body that it's time to wind down.</p>

        <p><strong class="highlight-text">5. Calculate Bedtime:</strong> Subtract the total of sleep cycles, sleep onset time, and wind-down time from your desired wake-up time. The result is your recommended bedtime.</p>

	  <p>Use tools such as the Epworth drowsiness Scale and evaluate the quality of your sleep to distinguish between fatigue and drowsiness. 
	  An increased sleep score (over 10) may indicate the need for better sleep. Factors like a hectic schedule or adverse drug reactions might cause fatigue.
	  Since weariness is frequently linked to medical concerns, it is advisable to see a doctor if it continues. If you don't have a primary care physician, 
	  get medical treatment through insurance resources or neighborhood clinics.</p>

        <p><strong>1. Establish a Sleep routine:</strong>A sleep cycle typically lasts around 90 minutes. Aim for 5 to 6 complete sleep cycles. Multiply the number of cycles by 90 to get the total sleep time.
											 Even on weekends, stick to a regular sleep routine by going to bed and getting up at the same times every day. This aids in the internal clock regulation of your body. </p>

        <p><strong>2. Calm Bedtime Routine:</strong>Before going to bed, do something relaxing like read a book, take a warm bath, or work on relaxation methods. Stay away from technology and stimulating activities right before bed. </p>
        <p><strong>3. Sleep Environment:</strong>Make sure your bedroom is a comfortable place to sleep. Maintain the space at a pleasant temperature, calm, and darkness. Invest in pillows and a comfy mattress. </p>

        <p><strong>4. Frequent Exercise:</strong>Get moving on a regular basis, but steer clear of strenuous exercise just before bed. It has been demonstrated that exercise improves mood and sleep quality. </p>

        <p><strong>5. Consider cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT-I) :</strong> an organized program that assists in identifying and substituting ideas and actions that either cause or exacerbate sleep issues. </p>

	  <p><strong>1. Sunlight Exposure:</strong>Throughout the day, especially in the morning, take in some natural light. This facilitates better sleep at night and increases alertness throughout the day by balancing your body's circadian cycle. </p>
	  <p><strong>2. Techniques for Mindfulness and Relaxation:</strong>As part of your nightly ritual, try deep breathing exercises, gradual muscular relaxation, or mindfulness meditation. These methods can assist in stress reduction and mental calmness.</p>
	  <p><strong>3. Maintain a Consistent Sleep Environment:</strong>Make sure your bedroom is cozy and clear of clutter. If necessary, use earplugs or a white noise machine. Blackout curtains are one option for blocking off light from the outside.</p>
	  <p><strong>4. Limit Clock Watching:</strong>Throughout the night, fight the impulse to check the time. Anxiety over not getting enough sleep might be exacerbated by an obsession with checking the time.</p>
	  <p><strong>5. Handle Pain and Discomfort:</strong>Take care of any bodily pain or discomfort if it's keeping you from sleeping. In order to reduce discomfort in particular regions, think about utilizing cushions or supports.</p>
